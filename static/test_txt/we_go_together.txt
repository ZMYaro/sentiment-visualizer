How long is this gonna take?
Here we go!
Don't make me do this.
Oh, you're gonna love it!
We're like a branch and its vine.
Like a drunk and his wine.
Like the leaves and the breeze.
Fatty food and disease.
And like a sheep and a lamb.
Like a pig and a ham.
We go together—.
Can I go now? ...can I just...?
Just like Shakespeare and verse.
Like a corpse and a hearse.
Like a song and a dance.
Like the English and France.
Like a Persian and rugs.
Like a headache and drugs.
We go together, you and I.
We go together like the news and the weather.
We fit like hand in glove.
For now and forever
Just like birds of a feather
We fly so high above.
We stick together like the earth and the sun.
Like a dentist and fun.
We go like honey and bees.
Like a mold on a cheese.
And like a bird and its nest.
Like a clown and depressed.
We go together, you and I.

We go together and we know that whatever,
We're stuck like nails and glue.
There's nothing can sever
Such a well-made endeavour as me—
—And me
—And you.
I guess it's true,
We're like a yawn and a dream.
Like a cherry on cream.
Like the wind and a kite.
Now you've got it, all right!
We're like a parent and child!
Like a—sorry, what?!
We go together, you and I.
You and me.
We go together, me and you.
That's right, we do!
We go together...you and I!
