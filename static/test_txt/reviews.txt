What can I say about this terrible, awful, miserable place. The staff of the restaurant is horrible and the eggplant is bad. Apart from that, very uninspired food, lack of atmosphere and too expensive. I am a staunch vegetarian and was sorely disappointed with the veggie options on the menu. This will be the last time I visit, I recommend others avoid this horrid place at all costs.

Salsa's
In a pinch, it's good mexican-style fast food. The burritos may disappoint, since the ingredients are usually clumped together in the end. The quesadillas are structurally unsound and will collapse, dripping all over you. The quesadillas used to be pretty great, but they switched from a press to a conveyor belt oven a few years ago. It's a real shame.

ABC Kitchen
Had a great dinner here. Food was downright delicious.  Particularly loved the crab toasts, and the pizzas were amazing (albeit none of them were offered with meat). The chocolate cake for dessert was nice too. Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance is cozy and warm. Pricing was pretty reasonable too.
